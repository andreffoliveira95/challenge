# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Used React.js 18 as a JS framework, with React Router v.5 (and not the latest one v.6) since I was more familiar with it.
Also, used Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework for 2 reasons:

    1) I wanted to develop a project using Tailwind as I never used it despite the fact that I've had seen some documentation before.
    2) I find Tailwind CSS more flexible than Bootstrap since it is not component-based and I wanted to have that flexibility for this project.

# ABOUT JEST AND REACT TESTING LIBRARY

I was not familiar with Jest nor React Testing Library.
I tried to learn the most that I could and apply what I've learned into this project.
I would have liked to program more about tests but I didn't have the time to go even further.

# WEBPACK

Another technology that I was not familiar with.
I also learned some things about this technology but didn't have the time to actually bundle this code.
But I'm totally happy to talk about it.
